            <p>At Go Bella Wellness, we strive to provide the best possible shopping experience for our customers. Please review the following policies to ensure a smooth transaction:</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">No Returns Policy</h4>
            <p>Due to the nature of our products, all sales are final. We do not accept returns or exchanges. We encourage you to carefully review your order before completing your purchase.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Shipping Timeframes</h4>
            <p>Orders are processed within 1-2 business days. Shipping times can vary depending on the carrier and destination, but typically range from 1 to 2 weeks. Please note that delays may occur due to factors outside our control, such as customs processing or postal service delays.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Order Tracking</h4>
            <p>Once your order has shipped, you will receive a confirmation email with a tracking number. This will allow you to monitor the progress of your shipment directly with the carrier.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Shipping Delays and Lost Packages</h4>
            <p>While we make every effort to ensure timely delivery, Go Bella Wellness is not responsible for delays caused by the carrier. If your order is delayed or lost, please contact the shipping provider with your tracking information. We will assist where possible but cannot guarantee resolution for lost packages.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Incorrect Shipping Information</h4>
            <p>Please ensure that all shipping information is correct at the time of purchase. Go Bella Wellness is not responsible for orders shipped to incorrect addresses provided by the customer. In the event of a shipping error, please contact the carrier directly for assistance.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Customs and Import Fees</h4>
            <p>For international orders, any customs duties or import fees are the responsibility of the recipient. These fees are not included in the purchase price and may vary based on the destination country. Please check with your local customs office for more information before placing an order.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Damaged Products</h4>
            <p>If your product arrives damaged or defective, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery at info@gobellawellness.com. Be sure to include your order number and photos of the damage, and we will work with you to resolve the issue.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-6">Order Cancellations</h4>
